# Camp Durant

Camp Durant is a Scout camp located in Moore County, NC and is the home of Nello Tear Lake.  This topographic map was generated using the [SPATIAL Data Download](https://sdd.nc.gov/) service provided by the state of North Carolina.  The digital elevation models were then loaded into [qGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and the contours generated and exported.  Those contours were then imported into [Inkscape]() and cleaned up and split into multiple layers.  These layers were then exported using the [export layers]() plugin for Inkscape to generate the [parts]().  The parts were visualized using [OpenSCAD]() to check for misaligned / floating parts.
